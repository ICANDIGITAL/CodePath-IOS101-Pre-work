## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
- Google Maps
    * Allows users to navigate to desired destinations.
    * Has a built in directory of information of the businesses that are shown.
    * Has options such as car, bike, public transportation. With accruate ETA's.
    
- YouTube
    * Allows indepedent content creators to compete on the same platform as large corporations.
    * Can learn a number of skills for free on the platform. Such as new languages and how to use music synthesizers for sound design.
    * I can't remember a time when the service was interrupted.
    
- Kraken Pro
    * Allows small investors like myself to invest in crypto currency.
    * Provides accurate market data on a convenient platform with an intuitive design.
    * Provides free and valuble security advice in how to secure your crypto assets.
    
    I would like to build an app that connects independent musicians in the first world with professional mixing and mastering houses in the developing world. This would allow people in countries like the United States that would otherwise not be able to have their music properly mixed and mastered to be able to do so at affordable rates to begin with. Also, this will allow mixing and mastering studios in the developing world to gain income and connections from countries they are often times restricted from entering. This solves the problem of talented musicians often times having low quality production. If they are not signed or have patronage.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
 * I misread the directions and had to ask for clarification on Slack.
